# Movie Recommendation System
Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System repository!

This project serves as a trial demonstration of how a machine learning model, specifically a movie recommendation system, can be deployed using Streamlit Cloud Community, a platform that allows for easy deployment and sharing of data applications.

## About the Project
The Movie Recommendation System recommends movies to users based on their preferences and past interactions. It utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to analyze user behavior and provide personalized movie suggestions.

The application is hosted on Streamlit Cloud Community, enabling seamless access for users to explore and interact with the recommendation system.

## Usage
To access the Movie Recommendation System, simply follow the link below:
